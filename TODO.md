# Todo

- Add gyro calibration of some kind
- Implement HOLD feature for Auxiliary Controller
- Implement PWM Controller
- Add documentation on how to get to the current multiplication number. 
  1000 / (Rshunt * Rother) = 1000 / (0.0005*56000) = 35.714285714285715

  Controller system, how?

PWM usually has a 0 - 1 or maybe 1000-2000
